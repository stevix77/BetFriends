# BetFriend : Make bets between friends
Manage bets between friends

I am Steve VALENTIN, a software engineer interested about craftsmanship subjects. I'm doing this project to help anyone and show how I'm seeing clean architecture in differents languages/frameworks. It is my representation, learnt from differents persons, books, videos... Also, you will see how with clean architecture I can easily write tests.

# Languages/Frameworks

	Front : .NetMAUI, Angular, VueJS  
	Back : C# .Net, typescript NestJS, (PHP? symfony/laravel)  

# Usecases

	- add a friend
	- make a bet
	- accept/reject a bet
	- give bet result
	- display bets list
	- create an account
	- authenticate

Usually, the approach is to make all of usecases with a language and switch to an other after. I wanted to doing differently and change language after each usecase. I am a C# .net developer, so it's possible that I'm writing code with few languages that you have never seen elsewhere or that we could write better or differently.
I give you details in each project folder
